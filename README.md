# NOTES:
1. I want to make a note here that I changed the code for talking heads to be more optimized for what I want (blinking and mouth movement). Other features may not work since I am not loading those models in. The difference cen be found in Talking_Head/tha2/poser/modes/mode_20.py. The commit hash of the change is 2097ca7f172a055cc533e4c1d777649fce38eae0
